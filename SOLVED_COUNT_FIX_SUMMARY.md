# Solved Count Fix Summary

## 🐛 Issue Identified
The "solved" status was not updating properly in the leaderboard and challenge cards. The leaderboard showed "0 challenges" solved even though teams had points, and challenge cards showed "0 solved" even though teams had solved them.

## 🔍 Root Cause
The `updateLeaderboard()` function in `server/routes/leaderboard.js` was not calculating and including the `solvedCount` field for each team. It was only including:
- `rank`
- `teamName` 
- `members`
- `score`
- `lastSubmission`

But missing:
- `solvedCount`

## ✅ Fix Applied

### 1. Updated Leaderboard Calculation
**File**: `server/routes/leaderboard.js`
**Function**: `updateLeaderboard()`

**Before**:
```javascript
snapshot.forEach(doc => {
  const data = doc.data();
  leaderboard.push({
    rank,
    teamName: doc.id,
    members: data.members,
    score: data.score || 0,
    lastSubmission: data.lastSubmission || null
  });
  rank++;
});
```

**After**:
```javascript
snapshot.forEach(doc => {
  const data = doc.data();
  const submissions = data.submissions || [];
  const solvedCount = submissions.filter(sub => sub.correct).length;
  
  leaderboard.push({
    rank,
    teamName: doc.id,
    members: data.members,
    score: data.score || 0,
    solvedCount,
    lastSubmission: data.lastSubmission || null
  });
  rank++;
});
```

### 2. Added Leaderboard Refresh Endpoint
**File**: `server/routes/leaderboard.js`
**New Endpoint**: `POST /api/leaderboard/refresh`

```javascript
// Refresh leaderboard (force update)
router.post('/refresh', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    await updateLeaderboard();
    res.json({ message: 'Leaderboard refreshed successfully' });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Refresh leaderboard error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to refresh leaderboard' });
  }
});
```

## 🧪 Verification Results

### ✅ Leaderboard API Response
**Before Fix**:
```json
{
  "rank": 1,
  "teamName": "pavankumar",
  "members": [...],
  "score": 10,
  "lastSubmission": {...}
}
```

**After Fix**:
```json
{
  "rank": 1,
  "teamName": "pavankumar", 
  "members": [...],
  "score": 10,
  "solvedCount": 1,
  "lastSubmission": {...}
}
```

### ✅ Challenge API Response
**Challenge Data**:
```json
{
  "id": "eEM0kRphYkr0I8KZj6aL",
  "title": "flag1",
  "solvedCount": 1,
  "solvedBy": ["pavankumar"]
}
```
